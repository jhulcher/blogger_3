#### Taking paradata.io as inspiration, I've deliberately rebuilt the entire site from scratch using Craft CMS
#### All Craft templates, HTML & CSS were written by me, custom, for this project
#### No code of any type was borrowed from the original site
#### Many images have been resized for speed of loading
#### Many background images were found, edited & re-colored by me for use with this project

## The new site features everything that the current site has, but now with Content Management

- [ ] Site is now easily editable via the admin control panel, accessed by the "Log In" button
- [ ] Any computer-literate employee could now edit the text & image content on the live site
- [ ] Virtually all imagery & text-base content is now supplied by Craft CMS entries
- [ ] CSS, Javascript, HTML, etc are all still hard-coded
- [ ] The site now features a blog, which allows guest-user comments, with immediate persistence
- [ ] Images can be uploaded directly to the control panel without git pushing
- [ ] The CMS now allows users to persist score requests & immediately receive confirmation
